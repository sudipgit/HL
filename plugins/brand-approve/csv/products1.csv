We’ve also added Agave Nectar to ensure that your curls, coils, kinks and waves keep moisture locked in and are extra-healthy.","WHICH HAIR MILK LEAVE-IN MOISTURIZER IS RIGHT FOR YOUR HAIR TYPE?
If you find your hair feeling dry all the time, or it dries out as the day goes on, give Hair Milk Original Leave-In Moisturizer a try.
If you worry about products leaving hair greasy, or your roots get weighed down quickly, try the Hair Milk Lite Leave-In Moisturizer instead.
DIRECTIONS:
After co-washing, apply a quarter-size amount into soaking-wet hair, working it in evenly with your fingers. Use your hands to gently squeeze out excess water or use a cotton T-shirt for best results. Add more as necessary and style as desired. 


DON’T SKIP THE MOISTURIZER…EVER
Curls need extreme moisture—much more moisture than straight hair. It’s hard for natural oils, produced by the scalp, to make their way down to the ends of a coil; this is why curly hair is usually more dry, brittle and frizzy. The key is using good moisturizing products that will soak into each strand. Well-moisturized curls have better definition and maintain styles longer, so don’t forget this step.

Applying leave-in moisturizers to wet hair makes it a hundred times easier. When hair is wet, the moisturizer will work in much more quickly and evenly through your curls and prevent it from tangling.

Cream moisturizers are great for curly hair because their nourishing ingredients coat and work to seal-in moisture. Also, they won’t evaporate throughout the day, so you won’t need to rehydrate again and again as the day goes on.
