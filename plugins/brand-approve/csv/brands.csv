Hair Art was once considered a fad but has now become as main stream as tattoos.  When barbers and stylists create hair art, they are creating a design in the hair with their trimmers & razors. These designs can be geometric, sports and company logos, cartoon characters and even famous faces.  Graff*Etch color pencils are used to color in the hair to make the designs stand out. Graff*Etch pencils were created for newly shaved sensitive skin. They are not ordinary eyeliner pencils. They were specially formulated to apply on a tender scalp and in the hair. Each pack contains 8 pencils with a sharpener built into each cap. Our pencils have the proper combination of texture, long lasting wear and ease of application. Graff*Etch pencils apply creamy smooth, won’t drip down if you sweat and will stay-put until you wash it out with shampoo or a cleanser. Graff*Etch pencils were made because barbers and stylists need proper tools to be more creative. It\'s a fun and temporary way to express yourself.
