It softens hard dry skin allowing for the prevention of razor bumps and ingrown hairs. Shave Therapy contains natural anti-fungal and anti-bacterial ingredients to fight off infections and inflammation of the skin.

10340,"Classic Natural Highlights Henna Color ","Because henna is the healthy alternative to hair coloring and the ultimate solution for every womans needs, Reshma Femme originally started off with Reshma Henna powder. Henna comes from the fresh, ground-up leaves of the henna plant, Lawsonia Inermis, and is grown on farms in the state of Rajasthan, India. Reshma Henna uses the purest and finest form of Henna. The products contains no Ammonia or Peroxide.","Semi-permanent color completely covers colors hair and lasts for up to 4 to 6 weeks
Provides vibrant color for lighter hair; makes darker hair softer and richer; covers gray hairs
Henna gently coats the hair by sealing in moisture, making the hair thicker, stronger, shinier and lustrous
Purest and finest form of Henna; contains no Ammonia or Peroxide; won't damage hair
","Pour the Reshma Henna powder into a bowl. Gradually add water and Reshma Hair Oil. Mix thoroughly into a thick creamy, paste-like consistency and let sit for ½-2 hours. Wear gloves to protect against staining. Apply paste to hair evenly. Leave in for 1-3 hours. Rinse well until water runs clear, then shampoo and condition. We recommend using Reshma Femme Luster (shampoo) and Reshma Femme Crème (conditioner).

Application Tips:
Cover skin with barrier cream to avoid staining.
Add 1 tsp. of lemon juice to help enhance and release the color more effectively.
If color is as important to you as conditioning with henna, add to your powder a 50/50 ratio of water and lemon juice.
Make sure your water is cool to lukewarm; this will help you get positive results that you desire. Hot water will cook the henna and will not yield optimum results.
For a deeper red, add 2 tbsp.of brewed tea to the henna mixture.
For a deeper brown, add 2 tbsp.of brewed coffee to the henna mixture.
Leave in longer if you desire a deeper shade.
Can be applied over dry hair.
Reshma Femme Henna reapplication is recommended every 2-4 weeks.
Henna can be used on permed hair after 2 weeks or 5 shampoo cycles.
